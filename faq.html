        <section>
            <h2>Is this for me?</h2>
            <p>If you like technology and computers in general then software development is definitely an option to consider. You don't have to be a math whiz but students who do well in math typically grasp programming quicker. Our industry also changes frequently so this field is great for people who like to learn continuously. Programming is hard and does take quite a bit of effort to learn. That is why having an instructor to help you troubleshoot and ask questions is so critical to your success in this industry. If you put in the effort to learn programming and ask questions, you will be successful!</p>
